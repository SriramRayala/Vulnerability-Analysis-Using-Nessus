Title: Comprehensive Framework for Vulnerability Analysis Using Nessus Essential on Windows VM

Objective: This framework outlines the step-by-step process to perform a comprehensive vulnerability analysis on a Windows virtual machine (VM) using Nessus Essential.

Prerequisites:

Nessus Essential account and activation code.
A Windows VM installed on VirtualBox.
Nessus Essentials and VM configured correctly.
Framework:

Step 1: Setup Nessus Essential

1.1 Create Nessus Account

Register for a Nessus Essential account by visiting the official website.
1.2 Activate Nessus

Check your email for the activation code sent by Nessus after registration.
Copy the activation code from the email.
1.3 Download Nessus

Visit the Nessus website and download the version suitable for your operating system (OS).
1.4 Configure Nessus

Open Nessus Web Client on your browser and initiate setup.
Enter the activation code when prompted.
Complete the configuration.
1.5 Set Password

After configuration, set a secure password for your Nessus account.
Log in to Nessus with your credentials.
1.6 Plugin Installation (if needed)

Check if Nessus plugins are installed. If not, upload the plugins file.
Configure plugins and restart the Nessus Web Client.
Step 2: Prepare Windows VM

2.1 Windows VM Setup

Install a Windows Enterprise version or a suitable free version on VirtualBox.
2.2 Network Configuration

Ensure the Windows VM has a proper IP configuration.
Verify network connectivity by pinging the VM from the host.
Step 3: Vulnerability Scanning

3.1 First Scan - Basic Network Scan (No Credentials)

Disable the Windows firewall for all profiles (domain, private, public) and restart the VM.
Ping the Windows VM to ensure connectivity.
In Nessus, create a Basic Network scan, provide the Windows VM's IPv4 address, and save it.
Start the scan.
3.2 Analyze Scan Results

After the scan is complete, review the vulnerabilities, CVSS scores, and remediation options.
3.3 Second Scan - Basic Network Scan with Credentials

On the Windows VM, enable the "Remote Registry" service.
Enable file sharing across devices.
Disable User Account Control (UAC).
Modify the registry to create a Local Account Token Filter Policy and set it to 1.
Restart the Windows VM.
Create a new Nessus scan, input Windows VM credentials, and start the scan.
3.4 Compare Results

Compare the results of the second scan with the first to identify improvements.
3.5 Third Scan - Software Vulnerability Scan

Install an older version of software (e.g., Firefox) on the Windows VM.
Perform a Nessus scan to identify vulnerabilities related to the installed software.
3.6 Analyze Results

Review the results of the software vulnerability scan and address any issues found.
Conclusion:
This comprehensive framework covers the setup of Nessus Essential, preparation of the Windows VM, and three types of vulnerability scans to help you assess and secure your Windows virtual environment.
